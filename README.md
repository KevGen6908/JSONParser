Hi everybody. This project implements a simple example of the work of a JSON parser that implements the basic principles of calculation:
Classes with fields (primitives, block types, null, arrays, classes)
Arrays
Collections
It is based on JavaCC with JSON grammar

The ClassToParser directory contains JSON files and the corresponding classes for these files. They are implemented for testing the project. 

The JavaCCParser directory is a JSON grammar from the JavaCC JAR

The main implementation is in the JSONObject class

There are ready-made tests in the project
